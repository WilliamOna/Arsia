When Estadu was in their late twenties, they were part of another pirate crew called *The Reaper*. At the time, it was captained by the legendary pirate Raymond 'One Legged' Armstead. Raymond was known for their aggressive Ruthlessness and ability to command a fleet of a dozen ships. They were the favorite candiate to lead a new pirate coalition that encompassed The Sea of Daggers.Raymond had 3 proteges whom they depended on and were cultivating for leadership. Estadu, Landon 'Splinter' Hildom, and Aurelia 'Screwdriver' Vossler. Estadu was the their favorite student. Splinter was always jealous. Screwdriver was a screw up who was by far overshadowed by their contemporaries.

One day, Raymond suddenly passess away in their sleep at the ripe age of 55. Some think that it was the copious amounts of alcohol consumed at a regular basis. And naturally, others suspect foul play. With the death of such a renowned leader lead to the subsequent death of their culta-personalis, and any hope of re-establishing a pirate confederation in the Sea of Daggers was now dashed, much to the delight of many counries terrorized by the pirates.

Legend says that Raymond took the majority of their horde and sealed it away somewhere that no one would have thought to look. It is rumored to have untold riches but is incredibly difficult to find because Raymond allegedly paid a group of mages a fortune to resort to magical means of hiding their treasures. Many have searched for clues, but no one has any leads.

In actuality, Raymond created a set of runes that could be used to unlock the sealed cave. These runes are scattered across the world. Raymond also secretly bequeathed to each of their pupils a necessary component to finding the treasure:
- Estadu has a magical gadget that can locate runes
- Screwdriver has an enchanted manastone and instructions that were sewn into their hat
- Splinter has a specialized rune that is needed to calibrate the gadget

None of them know that any of them have these components or what they are for. They do know that Raymond was smart and wily.
