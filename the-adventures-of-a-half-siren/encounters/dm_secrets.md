1. A Boat is not a Home
    - [X] Estadu, Screwdriver, and Splinter were proteges of Captain Raymond
    - [ ] In actuality, Raymond created a set of runes that could be used to unlock the sealed cave. These runes are scattered across the world. Raymond also secretly bequeathed to each of their pupils a necessary component to finding the treasure:
        - [ ] Estadu has a magical gadget that can locate runes
        - [X] Screwdriver has an enchanted manastone and instructions that were sewn into their hat
        - [ ] Splinter has a specialized rune that is needed to calibrate the gadget
    - [ ] The crew that Osa is with is not the entire crew. The majority of the crew, along with Esatu's first mate got separated from the crew you are with about 3 months ago when the The second Pirate Coalation was defeated by a combined Zranian and Dhulian Armada.
    - [ ]The Old Hideout was on an island between the Principality of Mita and the Shogunate of Izu
    - [ ] Estatdu was a strong candidate to become the next Leader of the Pirate Coaltion, but that became moot when they lost the previous war
    - [ ] there is an island south of the Genpan Shogunate that has a tribal population of escaped convicts. A perfect place to create the next base and the place where Splinter is hiding out
